This document will serve as a log for custom settings on a Windows machine.  This will be useful if I reformat or want to move to another computer.

It may be wise to figure out a script to set these settings up.

Install python, set environment variable: [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;C:\Python27", "User")

Write aliases in $profile file. Open with notepad.
Set policy for profile to run (error if you open new powershell with stuff in your profile file)
